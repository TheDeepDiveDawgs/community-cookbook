<br>
<p>As a power user I want to have my own profile I can use to post my own recipes as well as brows and rate the recipes<br>
other people add.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Name</strong>; Susan Grimble
<br>
<br>
<strong>Age</strong>; 68 years and counting
<br>
<br>
	<strong>profession</strong>; I'm retired from the post office. I stay busy looking after my grand kids after school<br>
and participating in bake sales for local fundraisers.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Technology</strong>; I do well with basic tools on my desktop and can use the internet moderately well but I dont<br>
own a cell phone. I can use popular websites with no trouble and enjoy looking up information on sites like wikipedia<br>
and cooking forums. I prefer to use google chrome to search, my grand kids tell me its the best one. my home computer came<br>
with windows seven which was nice but my grandson updated it to windows ten, I liked seven better but I'll use ten.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>; Susan stays busy with all the little things she likes to do. They say retirement is<br>
the number one killer of people in her situation but not for Susan, she finds ways to keep moving and active. she does sit<br>
	and watch the Martha Stuart show every time its on but aside from that she stays engaged most of her waking hours. The <br>
	things she likes most are her grand kids and showing off her culinary skills.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong>; Susan doesnt care for idle time, she wants to keep moving but even she has to<br>
sit down sometimes. During these times she likes to stay engaged but that can be challenging when retired. She wants to<br>
show off her skills in the kitchen but bake sales dont happen as often as she would like. Susan is great at the recipes<br>
she knows but would like to continue learning and showing off her superior cooking skills with new dishes.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Goals</strong>; Susan needs to stay mentally and physically engaged if she can do that by learning more about<br>
the art of cooking all the better. She also has a need to show off her skills and would like to help the community if possible.<br>
	Susan wants to learn as many as three new recipes a day and improve on them if she can.</p>
