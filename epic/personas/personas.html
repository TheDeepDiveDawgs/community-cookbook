<p> As I casual user I want to know what I can make with the ingredients I already have.</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong>; Fred Daniels</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Age</strong>; 20</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Profession</strong>; Im a full time student at the local university and I help out at a bicycle repair shop part time.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Technology</strong>; I have a good understanding of computers and how they work. Most of my experience <br>
		on them thus far has been playing video games, taking notes in class and browsing the web when I get bored. I am very <br>
		familiar with surfing the web to find just about anything.  </li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>; Fred lives in a fast paced world with all the school work and social <br>
		gatherings plus a part time minimum wage job to fit into his average week. Fred does not have a lot of time or money,<br>
	he would rather go out to a restaurant with friends but time and cash being as they are he ends up making ramen noodles <br>
		or a P,B and J more often then not. Fred wishes he could cook better or knew a few recipes off the top of his head.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong>; Fred is sick and tied of the few things his limited knowledge of cooking <br>
		allows him to make, he wants something different. He wants to experiment with culinary arts but he doesnt have the <br>
		time or the grocery money and delivery is out of the question. Fred is hungry now and ramen yet again just wont do. <br>
		He needs access to recipes he can make without spending any more money or time shopping.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Goals</strong>; Freds goal is to find a new dish (or at the very least a new spin on something old) that he <br>
		can make himself without having to leave his studio apartment. He does not want to spend any more money on food <br>
	 or any more time then necessary. He requires the knowledge on how to make something better or different with what he <br>
		currently has.</li>
</ul>
